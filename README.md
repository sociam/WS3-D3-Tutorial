WS3-D3-Tutorial
===============

This repository contains the sample code, introductory exercises and solutions to
eMax's Short Introductory Course on Information Graphics and Visualisation
taught as part of INFO6005 at the University of Southampton Computer Science Master's 
course, or the Open Data Institute in London.

Please see the attached pages/PDF file called 'exercises' for the actual exercises accompanying this code.

Feel free to use these exercises in your own courses; but do me the favour of [giving me bugfixes and improvements](https://github.com/sociam/WS3-D3-Tutorial) so that I can incorporate them in my lectures as well! 

Best
